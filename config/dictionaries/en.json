      "title": "How Moment LBS came to be",
      "text1": "There’s a fairly personal tale behind this app. In 2012 I left Kyiv and moved to the countryside. City habits meet rural reality — and chaos wins, at least for a while.",
      "text2": "I started a tiny quail farm in my backyard to produce meat. Two years, coffee, and a lot of counting later, I reached ~50 kg of quail meat per week. That meant juggling 14–15 overlapping batches and tracking 3,000+ birds. Paper notes multiplied like quails.",
      "text3": "By training I’m a programmer — so I wrote a PC app to track everything. It worked, but it wasn’t mobile. I still carried paper and transcribed data at the end of each day. Then a back injury forced me to close the farm and focus on the app — which turned out to be the best possible pivot: the next version became mobile-first and packed with practical fields like viability, transport info, and batch timing.",
      "text4": "Long story short: Moment LBS exists because someone had to stop losing eggs and start saving time. If you raise quails for meat, this app collects the tiny details you need — without making you learn SQL or wear a lab coat.",
